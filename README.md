Bitcoin Ticker

A simple IoT project using ESP32 and an LED display to show the latest Bitcoin price fetched from a public API.

--> 🛠️ Materials Required

ESP32 Development Board

LED Display (OLED / 7-Segment / Dot Matrix)

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

USB Cable (for programming)

Arduino IDE installed on your PC

--> 💻 Language & Tools Used

C/C++ (Arduino IDE) for programming the ESP32

Arduino Libraries:

WiFi.h (for internet connectivity)

HTTPClient.h (for API requests)

ArduinoJson (for parsing JSON response)

--> 📖 Tutorial (Setup & Usage)

Clone this repository:
